# Python solutions of Advent of Code 2025

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/elvetemedve/advent-of-code-2025.git
    cd advent-of-code-2025
    ```

2. Install Python 3
   At least  version 3.12.9 is required. The recommended method is to use Pyenv.

3.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
    Create a new virtual environment (the conventional name is `.venv`):

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

    Activate it for your current shell session:

    ```bash
    # On macOS and Linux
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    Your shell prompt should now be prefixed with `(.venv)`, indicating the environment is active.

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    The required packages for this course are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Launch JupyterLab**
    Many of the initial lectures use Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) for interactive demonstrations. You can launch the JupyterLab interface by running:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your web browser, allowing you to navigate the project folders and open any `.ipynb` notebook files.
